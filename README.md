# React - Daily Tales

### This is a fully functioning front-end React CRUD app, so you can create or read other's stories, with full editing options.

By utilizing the JSON-server package, we can handle the POST, PUT and DELETE requests to the mock back-end server, and we are providing it an initial JSON file (stories.json).  
All paging routes are being handled by the react-router-dom package.  
Lastly, all pages' styling was done using React Tailwind CSS.
